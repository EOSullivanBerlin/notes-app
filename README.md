# Evil Notes App
A single-page Javascript application that allows users to write notes send themselves by email.

## About
The app was built from the ground up, with no external libraries except [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server). We created our own testing frame-work to test drive the application based off Jasmine.
